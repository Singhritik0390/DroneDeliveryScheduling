# DroneDeliveryScheduling
Revenue-driven Scheduling in a Simulated Drone Delivery Network

A Unity 2018.3.0f2 project written in C# that simulates the operations of a drone courier company within a city in order to benchmark different delivery scheduling algorithms driven by a Time Value of Service Delivery agreement, providing metrics that give an insight into both profitability and customer satisfaction. This service level agreement is a monotonically decreasing function of time, such that the customer pays less the later they receive their package.

Sixteen scheduling behaviours have been implemented and tested over six hour simulations, with multiple exceeding the previous state-of-the-art scheduler (Least Lost Value) in terms of profitability. A full evaluation of each, as well as full details on the project, can be found within the included report.

This project was made as my final year individual project and dissertation at Imperial College London.
